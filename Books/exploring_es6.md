# 1. About ECMAScript

The language is evolved by the TC39 (Technical Committee 39). Who define the new specifications for
each release.

JavaScript official name is ECMAScript since 'Java' is trademarked by Oracle. It's named ECMAScript after 
the Ecma international organization which is a standard organization that manages the language standard.

Javascript has the commitment of "One Javascript" which mean no version of the language will not be compatible backwards.

ECMAScript releases:
* ECMASCript1 (1997)
* ECMASCript2 (1998)
* ECMASCript3 (1999). Introduced a lot af new features
* ECMAScript4 (never released)
* ECMASCript5. A superset of ES3 (originally was ES3.1) but less ambitious than what ES4 was. It's the version most browsers support today.
* ECMAScript6/ECMAScript2015 (2015). This book. Is a superset of ES5 (this secures forward compatibility. All ES5 code is ES6 code). Its official name is ECMAScript2015, however everyone knows it as ES6
* ECMAScript2016. From this point on, the language will recieve small yearly updates and will be named after its year release
